## Current State

### Tab — closed
All 8 variants verified. close-off/close-on SVGs from source export wired. No gaps.

### InputBox — closed
All 4 states (default/focus/disabled/error) implemented and verified.
Geometry stable via inset box-shadow. Icons use inline SVG + currentColor.
Commits: `d6afa94`, `ef0099c` in agentic-browser-ui.
focus-shadow mismatch noted by Codex — accepted as-is, not a blocker.

### Toolbar — closed
All 5 states verified and pushed.
Commits: `eb13c90`, `dbd1136` in agentic-browser-ui.
Provisional boards confirmed:
- NavIcon disabled (`1872:10395`): opacity 0.3 on button wrapper ✓
- Bookmark bookmarked + URLBar focused (`1873:10395`): icons correct ✓
Deferred non-blocker: `border border-[0.5px]` redundancy in `urlFocused`.

### Dialog — in progress
Phase 4 validation case for the merged `figma-execution-shell`.
`figma-execution-shell` skeleton merged via PR `#18`; shell v2 gate tightening merged via PR `#19`.

Current implementation status:
- Dialog structure and variant axes are implemented in `agentic-browser-ui`
- close hover forcing, image-content branch, image spacing shell, image circle close, and real image verify asset were all fixed
- implementation is now synced in `agentic-browser-ui` PR `#1`

Current closeout state:
- code-level blockers identified by Codex are currently resolved
- final browser-side visual confirmation is still the last closeout step

Current status should be treated as:
- implementation-complete
- verification-partial until final visual confirmation is recorded

## Next Recommended Action

Finish the final Dialog browser-side visual confirmation, close the case, then decide whether shell / verify-quality needs one more focused patch.

## Source-of-Truth Notes

- Skill rules live in `skills/*/README.md` — authoritative for agent behavior
- Workflow rules live in `inventory/workflow-outline.md`
- CSS tokens live in `agentic-browser-ui/src/index.css`
- Exported assets live in `agentic-browser-ui/src/assets/figma/`
- FIGMA_TOKEN is available in env (set in `~/.zshrc`) — export workflow is unblocked
